    "Pandas is the primary package for performing data analysis tasks in Python. pandas derives its name from <b>PANel Data AnalysiS</b> and is the fundamental package that provides <b>relational data structures (think Excel, SQL type) and a host of capabilities to play with those data structures</b>. It is the most widely used package in Python for data analysis tasks, and is very good to work with <b>cross sectional, time series, and panel data analysis</b>. Python sits on top of NumPy and can be used with NumPy arrays and the functions in NumPy. How is pandas suited for a researcher’s needs:\n",
    "<i>\n",
    "+ Has a tabular data structure that can hold both <b>homogenous and heterogenous data</b>.\n",
    "+ Very <b>good indexing capabilities</b> that makes data alignment and merging easy.\n",
    "+ Good <b>time series functionality</b>. No need to use different data structures for time series and cross sectional data. Allows for both <b>ordered and unordered time-series data</b>.\n",
    "+ A host of <b>statistical functions</b> developed around NumPy and pandas that makes a researcher’s task easy and fast.\n",
    "+ Programming is lot <b>simpler and faster</b>.\n",
    "+ Easily handles <b>data manipulation and cleaning</b>.\n",
    "+ Easy to expand and shorten data sets. <b>Comprehensive merging, joins, and group by functionality to join multiple data sets</b>.\n",

    "**Series:** It is similar to a NumPy 1-dimensional array. In addition to the values that are specified by the programmer, <b>pandas attaches a label to each of the values</b>. If the labels are not provided by the programmer, then pandas assigns labels ( 0 for first element, 1 for second element and so on). A benefit of assigning labels to data values is that it becomes easier to perform manipulations on the dataset as the whole dataset becomes more of a dictionary where each value is associated with a label.
